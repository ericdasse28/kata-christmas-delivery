# Kata Christmas Delivery

## Statement
Due to large population growth in the world, Santa Claus is having to change his existing process.

Currently, only one Elf can put a present on his Sleigh at a time and Santa wants to be able to use
multiple Elves.

In order to receive presents yourself this year, you'll have to design a system to support his changing
process.


### User Story 1
Start off by recreating the current system Santa has.

Currently his system allows a single delivery elf to move presents onto his Sleigh.

`Toy machine -> (Gives present) -> Elf -> (Packs into) -> Santa Sleigh`

Once a delivery elf has a present, it will take him a while to put it onto Santa's Sleigh. Once he has,
he calls back to say he's available to transport another present.
